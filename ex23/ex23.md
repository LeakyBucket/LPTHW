## Analysis

_apidoc.py_  

The file builds a recursive list of files from the given directory and parses them, generating documentation for the source files.  

The file seems pretty clean up to the last method.  At this point it gets real ugly and a bit schitzo.  It would appear that the main method parses command line options as well as building a list of module names then generating documentation for all the modules it finds.
